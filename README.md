# Event Driven Data Pipeline
A similar project to one of the original founder of Confluent, Ben Stopford. This project is going to use Kafka as the source of truth of your data. This makes it a challenging distributed system problem. </br>
The [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) is entirely inspired by confluent. Confluent Inc essentially has provided the best images ready for running Kafka.
